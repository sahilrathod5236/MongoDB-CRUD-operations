# "Node JS - Express - MongoDB with Mongoose"

**Description:**

- This is a back-end project, created using Node.js, Express and MongoDB.
- The Node.js is connected to the database (MongoDb) using Mongoose.
- Once the user registers, the user data and password (hashed using bcrypt) is saved in the database.
- Each user is granted specific roles.
- On user login and successful authentication, a JWT (JSON WEB TOKEN) access token is generated, which lets the user perform actions and get information based on his role.
